# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Trying to implement (re-type for now) Go lang Linked List implementation.

**Thoughts:** Feeling insanely frustrated with pointers, interfaces and pretty much every other language feature >_< I hope I'll get used to it.

### Day 0: Jan 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Pair programming at work with I.W.

**Thoughts:** I think I like TDD, at least when you are not alone.
