# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: Jan 8, 2018
**Today's Progress**: project file structure and package
**Thoughts:** Very lazy day, was mostly reading The Go Programming Language book

### Day 5: Jan 7, 2018
**Today's Progress**: #codewars and #golang again
**Thoughts:** Feeling better with simple Go stuff. Although noticed a disadvantage in codewars - I spend more time on algorithm/kata solving than actual code writing. I think at this point it would be more helpful to focus on language specifics, data types manipulations, etc.

### Day 4: Jan 6, 2018
**Today's Progress**: #codewars, fundamentals and simple data types manipulations
**Thoughts:** I think doing simple codewars is a better option at this point compared to more advanced language usage. I'll try to stick with codewars for a few more days before jumping into more advanced stuff.

### Day 3: Jan 5, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Read The Go Book about pointers and other language concepts. Tried to code a few examples.
**Thoughts:** Feeling frustrated. I think I should switch to codewars or something similar for the next few days.

### Day 2: Jan 4, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Added functionality to the Linked List implementation.
**Thoughts:** Spent too much time on other things tonight and was extremely unproductive and sleepy during the evening golang session.

### Day 1: Jan 3, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Trying to implement (re-type for now) Go lang Linked List implementation.
**Thoughts:** Feeling insanely frustrated with pointers, interfaces and pretty much every other language feature >_< I hope I'll get used to it.

### Day 0: Jan 2, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Pair programming at work with I.W.
**Thoughts:** I think I like TDD, at least when you are not alone.
